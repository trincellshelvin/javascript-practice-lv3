# Assignment: Basic Exercises for .map() Function in Node.js

## Overview
This assignment is designed to help you practice using the `.map()` function in JavaScript. You will work with arrays to transform their elements using the `.map()` method. The exercises cover a range of use cases including multiplying numbers, transforming strings, and working with objects. This will give you a solid foundation for using `.map()` in real-world scenarios.

## How to Use
- Write your solutions directly in the provided JavaScript file.
- Run the file using Node.js to test your solutions.
- For each problem, the goal is to practice transforming data using `.map()`. Some problems may also require you to use `.join()` to convert an array into a string.

## Examples
Here are three examples that demonstrate how to use `.map()`:

1. **Multiply Each Element by 2**:
   - Given an array of numbers, the `.map()` function is used to create a new array where each element is multiplied by 2.
   - Example output: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`

2. **Convert Strings to Uppercase**:
   - Given an array of strings, the `.map()` function is used to create a new array where each string is converted to uppercase.
   - Example output: `['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'JAVASCRIPT', 'NODE']`

3. **Extract Names from Objects**:
   - Given an array of objects representing people, the `.map()` function is used to create a new array containing only the names of the people, and `.join()` is used to combine them into a single string.
   - Example output: `'Alice, Bob, Charlie'`

## Problems
The assignment includes 10 problems for you to solve. Each problem is worth **2 points**. For each problem, you'll be provided with an initial array, and you must use `.map()` to transform it according to the instructions.

### Example Problems:
- **Problem 1**: Multiply each element of an array by 3.
- **Problem 2**: Convert an array of strings to lowercase.
- **Problem 3**: Extract ages from an array of objects representing people.
- **Problem 8-10**: Some problems require the use of `.join()` to combine the array elements into a single string.

## Running the Assignment
To run the assignment:
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the JavaScript file.
3. Run the file with the command:
   ```bash
   node map_exercises.js
   ```
4. Check the console output to verify your solutions.

## Goals
By completing this assignment, you will:
- Gain experience using `.map()` to transform arrays.
- Understand how to work with different data types, such as strings, numbers, and objects.
- Learn to chain array methods like `.map()` and `.join()` to perform multiple transformations.
